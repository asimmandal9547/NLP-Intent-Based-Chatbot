# Chatbot Model Training and Evaluation

This project is a simple **Intent-based Chatbot** built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**. The chatbot classifies user input into predefined intents and responds accordingly. The model is trained using **Logistic Regression**, and the text data is vectorized using **TF-IDF**.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to train a chatbot model that can classify user input into various intents, such as greeting, farewell, asking for help, etc. The model uses **TF-IDF** to transform text data and **Logistic Regression** to classify the intent of the user's input.

### Key Features:
- Preprocessing of textual data.
- Model training using **Logistic Regression**.
- Evaluation of the model's performance with metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**.
- Intent classification using the trained model.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. You can create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies as follows:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
# For Linux/MacOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` should include:
```
joblib
nltk
scikit-learn
```

### 4. Download NLTK resources
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Model Training

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Preprocess the data from the `intents.json` file.
2. Convert text patterns into **TF-IDF features**.
3. Train a **Logistic Regression** model.
4. Evaluate the model with **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score** metrics.
5. Save the model, vectorizer, and label encoder as `.pkl` files.

The output will include the model evaluation metrics, and the model will be saved as `model.pkl`, `vectorizer.pkl`, and `label_encoder.pkl`.

## Model Evaluation

After training the model, the script evaluates it using several metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Accuracy of the positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Ability to find all relevant positive instances.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.

The classification report also includes a detailed breakdown of each class (intent) performance.

## Files and Directories

- `main.py`: The main script to train and evaluate the model.
- `intents.json`: The dataset containing predefined intents and patterns.
- `preprocess.py`: Script to preprocess and clean the input data.
- `model.pkl`: The trained model (saved after training).
- `vectorizer.pkl`: The TF-IDF vectorizer (saved after training).
- `label_encoder.pkl`: The label encoder for encoding the intent labels (saved after training).
